### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of flex, positioning, and transitions.

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->

### Continued development

I'd like to focus on improving my JavaScript abilites in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Sitepoint Community](https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/centering-image-inside-flexbox/287444/5) - This site helped me to center a few unruly flexed items.
- [angel-rs](https://angel-rs.github.io/css-color-filter-generator/) - I love this repo. I use it all the time to convert colors, when necessary.
